database?

so, i just got an idea to make a server like website which would be password protected, so basscially a login page and upon proper input it opens a website
where all my passwords are located, i wanted this in java, but i did not think that would be very secure since i dont know how to hide the source code, so 
i want the website to be opened with java, i did research but nothing was to my liking other than robot, i didnt want to use robot i already knew about it but
just seems like a cheat out.

ill host the website on another github account.(turns out github doesnt allow htacces and htpasswd and doesnt allow server code so i will use 000webhost.)
i wont actiually use it, so i will just link it below-
